\subsubsection{Java}
  \begin{description}
    \item Know Java and it's principles but haven't really *worked* with it, beyond making projects with it at college.
  \end{description}
\subsubsection{Rust}
  \begin{description}
    \item Like it a lot. I've mainly played with it, but would love to work with Rust professionally some day. Developed an unfinished and super simple Jenkins CLI client with it, called jenr: \url{https://github.com/fermezz/jenr}.
  \end{description}

\subsection{Eventbrite – Software Engineer}
\subsubsection{Engineering Development Academy (EDA)}
  \begin{description}
    \item As a junior engineer I participated in the development academy Eventbrite has to introduce engineers getting out of college or with no/little experience into the tech industry.
  \end{description}
\subsubsection{Music Product}
  \begin{description}
    \item Built several features related to Eventbrite Music.
    \item Participated on building and maintaining the Artist Search feature so that organizers could search through \textasciitilde5M artists and tag some of them into their events.
    \item Designed, implemented, documented and maintained public and private API endpoints.
    \item Owned a specific service of our distributed architecture which had to respond up to \textasciitilde200 requests per second.
    \item Monitored the before mentioned services and overall infrastructure through tools such as DataDog, Graphite, Splunk, etc.
  \end{description}
\subsubsection{DevTools [Current]}
  \begin{description}
    \item I'm participating on building an maintaining our CI/CD process with mainly Jenkins.
    \item Supporting and maintining our built-in-house, Kubernetes-based development tool.

  \end{description}
\subsubsection{Tech Debt [Extra]}
  \begin{description}
    \item Participating on a project that consists in migrating all of our +100 repositories using Python from Python 2 to Python 3.
      For that to happen, we implemented and keep improving a bunch of Jenkins pipelines that run tests – with \href{https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}{Tox} and \href{https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/}{PyTest} – inside a Docker container.
    \item Participated on deprecating a built-in-house, very old ORM for Python in favor of the Django ORM.
    \item Was involved in a company-wide effort of breaking up a huge monolith into remote services.
